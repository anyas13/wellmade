This is a fullstack ecommerce web application which I build on my own as part of a side project at my internship. I received valuable input from senior engineers who
helped guide my progress. The app is built using Javascript, React, Redux, MongoDB, and Node.js. I also integrated the PayPal API to add to the functionality of
this application. 

While it is currently under construction as I rework the UI; therefore it is no longer hosted anywhere. I have a video which walks through the application - if interested please reach out for the link.
